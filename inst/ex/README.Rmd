## About the contents of this directory

This directory contains the two examples discussed in the paper, along
with the data and transcripts of R sessions. They are provided for
reference.

### Update

The files in this directory have all been updated to refer to the
current version of `distcomp`, version 1.3. All our examples work as
before (see the examples in the `doc` directory). The transcripts here
have been updated with session information.
