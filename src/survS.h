**
**   The S.h file defines a few things that I need, and hundreds that I don't.
** In particular, on some architectures, it defines a variable "time"
** which of course conflicts with lots of my C-code, 'time' being a natural
** variable name for survival models.
**   Thanks to Brian Ripley for suggesting a machine independent way of
** fixing this.
**
** The S_alloc function changed it's argument list from Splus version
**   4 to 5, and there is a different one for R.
**   The ALLOC macro allows me to have common C code for all versions,
**   with only this file "survS.h" changed.
