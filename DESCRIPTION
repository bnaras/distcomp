Description: Implementing algorithms and fitting models when sites
  share computation summaries rather than actual data, using
  'opencpu'. A stratified Cox model and a singular value
  decomposition algorithm are provided. The former makes direct use
  of code from the R 'survival' package. (That is, the underlying
  Cox model code is derived from that in the R 'survival' package.)
  Users may either use CSV data files or Redcap data sources for
  computations. An extensible design allows for new methods to be
  added. Web applications are provided (via 'shiny') for
  the implemented methods to help in designing and deploying the
  computations.
