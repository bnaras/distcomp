Description: Current implementations include a stratified Cox model and
  singular value decomposition. The former makes direct use of code
  from the R survival package. (That is, the underlying Cox model code
  is derived from that in the R survival package.) Users may either
  use CSV data files or Redcap data sources for computations. An
  extensible design allows for new methods to be added. Web
  applications are provided (via shiny) for the implemented methods
  to help in designing and deploying the computations.
